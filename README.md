### Kane's Wrath Custom Maps by Kirasaitru

All my past and present custom maps, or maps in progress, will be uploaded here for people to download, edit or play in-game/multiplayer. Some of the maps (the tank missions mostly, are created from original maps by others which are credited in the intro of the maps).

If my maps are edited, please give credit with a link to either my [GitHub](https://github.com/Kirasaitru/kw-maps) site or my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASgf1IsH99o_e-JU0FY-OA) channel.
For people who want to edit or create a custom map, take a look in the Worldbuilder section.
You may find tutorial videos on how to create custom maps in my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASgf1IsH99o_e-JU0FY-OA) channel.

To install a custom map, unzip/extract and paste the map folder into the correct path in Windows:
"USER/appdata/roaming/C&C Kanes Wrath/Maps"
The "appdata" folder can be entered by tapping windows button, or Win+R, and type %appdata%

NOTICE:
To download a map, just browse the directories and click on the map you want to download. It should appear a "Download" button. You can also just "Clone/Download" the whole project with all the files and maps included, click the "clone or download" button in the upper right area of the project main page.

UPDATE June 2018:
One day in June 2018 I used many hours making and testing a map in local skirmish, it worked fine and I was looking forward to play it with friends online. But KW just returnes desyncs all the time, update after update... I couldn't find out what the trigger to the problem was, most likely the trigger was the main script of the map, which I can't remove, because then I would have to rebuild the whole map :(
So after this (and this has happended many times before!), I decided that this will be my final map for good! I'm so tired of this old game which EA never patched to fix these shitty desyncs! I'm wasting my time trying to create new maps to be played online. This map, for example, had to be converted to a singleplayer map to work...
This will be my last edit on any map ever in Kane's Wrath! It was fun while it lasted :)
You can alwyas download and enjoy my old and tested maps which work withouts desyncs.
Cheers!
