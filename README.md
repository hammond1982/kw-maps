### Kane's Wrath Custom Maps by Kirasaitru (past erl115)

All my past and present custom maps, or maps in progress, will be uploaded here for people to download, edit or play in-game/multiplayer.
If edited, please give credit with a link to either my [GitHub](https://github.com/Kirasaitru/kw-maps) site or my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASgf1IsH99o_e-JU0FY-OA) channel.
For people who want to edit or create a custom map, take a look in the Worldbuilder section.
You may find tutorial videos on how to create custom maps in my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASgf1IsH99o_e-JU0FY-OA) channel.

To install a custom map, unzip/extract and paste the map folder into the correct path in Windows:
"USER/appdata/roaming/C&C Kanes Wrath/Maps"
The "appdata" folder can be entered by tapping windows button, or Win+R, and type %appdata%

NOTICE:
To download any file or map, just browse the directories and click on the file/map you want to download. It should appear a "Download" button when you have clicked into the file/map. Click the download button and open/extract the files using 7-zip or another software. Some files are just raw files which you can download and open without any third party software.
You can also just "Clone/Download" the whole project with all the files/maps included. I think this project takes about 40MB of size, so in other words, small size :P
