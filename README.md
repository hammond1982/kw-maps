Kane's Wrath Custom Maps by Kirasaitru (past erl115)

All my past and present custom maps, or maps in progress, will be uploaded here for people to download, share, edit or play in-game/multiplayer.

If edited, please credit me (Kirasaitru) with a link to my github site and my youtube channel.


To edit a map, you will need "Kane's Wrath Worldbuilder". To edit a radar image, you will need an image software (link below).

To install a custom map, unzip/extract and paste the map folder into the correct path in Windows:

"USER/appdata/roaming/C&C Kanes Wrath/Maps"

The "appdata" folder can be entered by clicking windows button, or Win+R, and type: %appdata%


I will upload some tutorial videos in the future on how to create custom maps for kanes wrath in my youtube channel:
