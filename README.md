Kane's Wrath Custom Maps by Kirasaitru (past erl115)

All my past and present custom maps, or maps in progress, will be uploaded here for people to download, store, share, edit or/and use in game

If edited, please credit me (Kirasaitru) with a link to my github site or/and my youtube channel


To edit a map, you will need "Kane's Wrath Worldbuilder". To edit the radar image, you will need a image software.

To install a custom map, copy the map folder and paste into the correct path in windows:

USER/appdata/roaming/C&C Kanes Wrath/Maps


Appdata folder can be accessed by clicking windows button and typing: %appdata%



I will upload some tutorial videos on how to create custom maps for kanes wrath in my youtube channel:
