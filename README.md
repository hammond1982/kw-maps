### Kane's Wrath Custom Maps by Kirasaitru (past erl115)

All my past and present custom maps, or maps in progress, will be uploaded here for people to download, edit or play in-game/multiplayer. Some of the maps (the tank missions mostly, are created from original maps by others which are credited in the intro of the maps).

If my maps are edited, please give credit with a link to either my [GitHub](https://github.com/Kirasaitru/kw-maps) site or my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASgf1IsH99o_e-JU0FY-OA) channel.
For people who want to edit or create a custom map, take a look in the Worldbuilder section.
You may find tutorial videos on how to create custom maps in my [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCASgf1IsH99o_e-JU0FY-OA) channel.

To install a custom map, unzip/extract and paste the map folder into the correct path in Windows:
"USER/appdata/roaming/C&C Kanes Wrath/Maps"
The "appdata" folder can be entered by tapping windows button, or Win+R, and type %appdata%

NOTICE:
To download a map, just browse the directories and click on the map you want to download. It should appear a "Download" button. You can also just "Clone/Download" the whole project with all the files and maps included, click the "clone or download" button in the upper right area of the project main page.
