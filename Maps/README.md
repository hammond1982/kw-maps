# Custom Maps

Feel free to download and play my custom maps, both in singleplayer and multiplayer mode.
You can also edit my maps as much as you want, as long as I'm credited for the original work :)

Almost all of my maps (99%) has been tested Online (also in singleplayer mode) and should be working fine without desyncs or bugs.
I try my best to test my maps online for bugs, desyncs and ofc balancing before I publish. But when I created some of the most recent ones, I did not have the time to test everything with online players. If you play maps in Skirmish SOLO, desyncs will not appear. Use AI/Computer on the enemy start position as usual when playing solo.

Multiplayer maps can be selected in the skirmish section of the game. Remember that some of the maps require an AI/Computer player to work correctly. Singleplayer maps can be selected in the custom maps section, Skirmish --> Custom maps.

Maps should be installed in this directory (both singleplayer and multiplayer maps):
"USER/appdata/roaming/C&C Kanes Wrath/Maps"
Windows 7,8 and 10.

### Free software for extracting the maps
* [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) - Free software to unzip, or extract, the map folders.
