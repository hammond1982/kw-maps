"To start the waves, buy tanks here. The tank you buy is the kind of waves you spawn. The harder the tank the more income you get each round. \n \n \n Difficulty gets harder the more kills you do, and you need a lot of kills to win. \n \n Lose all your structures/units and you will lose. \n \n Good luck Commander!"
