Be aware that I have encountered desyncs in the v1.1 of this map. I will maybe update the map next Christmas lol, but do not expect any updates from me. Kane's Wrath is full of stupid bugs and desyncs, and I do not wanna waste any more time debugging and updating the map.
You can always play it alone as a singleplayer map using the Skirmish mode.

Cheers!
